            <h2>How it's done</h2>
            <p>This website summarises weather data logged by a weather station using the polished and highly
                customisable
                <A href="http://weewx.com">WeeWX</a> software (version $station.version). WeeWX collects data from the
                weatherstation in a customisable interval and stores it in an archive database.
                It also creates all the data for the graphs and webpages which are uploaded to the website every interval.

                Optionally, using MQTT, the gauges and charts can be updated as the weatherstation sends a "loop" value.
            </p>

            <p>This website uses a custom skin which uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to deal with
                the layout and presentation. The gauges and the history tables are generated by JavaScript using
                <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html">Apache eCharts</a> and by Python scripts
                which hook into WeeWX.</p>

            <p>The code for this skin can be found on github:
                <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer">github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer</a>
            </p>

            <p>Having already a working WeeWX installation, the easiest way to install this skin is to download the
                source archive from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases">releases</a>,
                and use the WeeWX installer to unpack it:</p>
            <pre>wee_extension --install [wherever you've put the archive]</pre>

            <p>Set the page title and footer through the corresponding file for your language in
                <code>skins/Bootstrap/lang/{your_language}.conf</code>. Change the template language using
                lang = {your_language} in the section for your skin in <code>weewx.conf</code>
