Installation
============

Before we begin...
 1) This release (v2.21) has been tested on Weewx version 3.0.1, on Ubuntu linux 14.04 and on a Raspberry Pi running
    wheezy.
    Versions of Weewx before v3 will not work. The earlier release v2.01 is on github and works with Weewx 2.4 - 2.7.
 2) This has been tested on sqlite databases. Mysql and any other Weewx supported databases should work too.


Installation - The easy way
===========================

1) Get hold of the release archive from github:   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

2) Install it using the Weewx extension installer.

  a) If you have installed weewx yourself:
       cd /home/weewx [or where your base install is]
       ./setup.py install --extension [wherever you've put the .tar.gz archive]

  b) If you used the Debian installer:
       sudo wee_setup install --extension [wherever you've put the .tar.gz archive]

The installer will ask if you want to switch the themes to another language. You can change this later on
via the [Language] section in skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf and skins/Images/skin.conf.

Web content is stored in public_html/Bootstrap.

3) Set the page title and page footer through the [BootstrapLabels] section in skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf.

   [BootstrapLabels]

       # Labels specific to the Bootstrap template

       title = "The weather, [where you are]"
       location_href = ["#" for nothing, or a hyperlink to some more information on your location] 
       footer = "&copy; [who you are]"

4) Enjoy.... And let us know how you get on!

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1) I've installed the new skin but I only see the original Weewx pages.
     This template does not overwrite any existing templates which are generated in weewx.conf. For a new Weewwx
     installation, both the standard Weewx and the Bootstrap reports will be generated:
         Standard template:  http://[wherever your site is]
         Bootstrap template: http://[wherever your site is]/Bootstrap

     If you no longer want to generate the standard weewx template, comment out this section in weewx.conf:
         [StdReport]
             # [[StandardReport]]
             # skin = Standard

    Remember to leave in the [[SmallImages]], [[BigImages]] and [[HTMLPages]] sections which generate the 
    Bootstrap template content.


Installation - The involved way
===============================

Step 1 - Download from github:
------------------------------

To get the latest development code:
   git clone git://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer

To get the latest stable(ish) release, point your browser here:
   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

Move gaugeengine.py, gauges.py, historyengine,py and translateengine.py into the bin/user directory.
Move the Bootstrap and Images directory into the skins directory.
Move any language specific files you want into skins/languages.

Step 2 - Add the skins to weewx.conf
------------------------------------
The [StdReport] section will need to look something like this:

    [StdReport]
        # This section specifies what reports, using which skins, to generate.

        # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        SKIN_ROOT = skins

        # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        HTML_ROOT = public_html

        [[SmallImages]]
            # These are the images used on the front page of the website.
            # Dimensions are set in the Images/skin.conf file
            #
            skin = Images
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[BigImages]]
            # These images are used when a small web page image is clicked on.
            # So the skin.conf image_width and image_height are overridden here.
            #
            skin = Images
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap/big_images/
            [[[ImageGenerator]]]
                image_width = 800
                image_height = 500

        [[HTMLPages]]
            # This generates the webpages themselves.
            #
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[FTP]]
            skin = Ftp

        [[RSYNC]]
            skin = Rsync


Step 3 - Add Bootstrap support files to your website
----------------------------------------------------
Add these files to weewx/public_html/js:
    bootstrap.min.js
    ekko-lightbox.min.js

and this one to weewx/public_html/css:
    css/bootstrap.min.css

You can use the wget command to download these:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.21/public_html/Bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.21/public_html/Bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.21/public_html/Bootstrap/js/ekko-lightbox.min.js


Step 4 - (Optional) Display skins in another language
-----------------------------------------------------
Just choose your language using the "language" setting in the [Languages] section of skin.conf.

Remember to make changes to both skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf (for the html text) and skins/Images/skin.conf (for
the graphs).
