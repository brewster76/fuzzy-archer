Installation
============

Before we begin...
 1) This release (v3.0) has been tested on Weewx version 4.8.0 on Ubuntu linux 18.04 LTS and Python 3.6.9.
    Versions of Weewx before v3 will not work. The earlier release v2.01 is on github and works with Weewx 2.4 - 2.7.
 2) This has been tested on sqlite databases. Mysql and any other Weewx supported databases should work too.


Installation - The easy way
===========================

1) Get hold of the release archive from github:   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

2) Install it using the Weewx extension installer.

  a) If you used the Debian installer:
       sudo wee_extension --install=[wherever you've put the .tar.gz archive]

  b) If you have installed weewx yourself:
       cd /home/weewx [or where your base install is]
       bin/wee_extension --install=[wherever you've put the .tar.gz archive]

The installer will ask if you want to switch the themes to another language. You can change this later on
via the [Language] section in skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf and skins/Images/skin.conf.

Web content is stored in public_html/Bootstrap.

3) Set the page title and page footer through the [BootstrapLabels] section in skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf.

   [BootstrapLabels]

       # Labels specific to the Bootstrap template

       title = "The weather, [where you are]"
       location_href = ["#" for nothing, or a hyperlink to some more information on your location] 
       footer = "&copy; [who you are]"

4) Enjoy.... And let us know how you get on!

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1) I've installed the new skin but I only see the original Weewx pages.
     This template does not overwrite any existing templates which are generated in weewx.conf. For a new Weewwx
     installation, both the standard Weewx and the Bootstrap reports will be generated:
         Standard template:  http://[wherever your site is]
         Bootstrap template: http://[wherever your site is]/Bootstrap

     If you no longer want to generate the standard weewx template, comment out this section in weewx.conf:
         [StdReport]
             # [[StandardReport]]
             # skin = Standard

    Remember to leave in the [[SmallImages]], [[BigImages]] and [[HTMLPages]] sections which generate the 
    Bootstrap template content.

2) I've changed the units in skin.conf, but the original units persist on the webpage. [Pre weewx 4.0.0]
     The skin has two skin.conf files:
       skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf - This creates the gauges and the html files.
       skins/Images/skin.conf    - This creates the (daily, weekly, ...) history graphs.

      Make sure you've changed the units in both files.

      The reason for splitting the config files out is Images/skin.conf is run twice. Once to create the images for the
      webpage, and a second time for the expanded images which are shown when clicking on the webpage history graph.

3) The colors on the History page do not vary much
    The default color schemes are based around values in Fahrenheit and inches.
    Color schemes for Celsius and mm are also included in the [HistoryReport] section
    in skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf. Comment out the Fahrenheit and inches lines and uncomment the  Celsius and mm lines.

4) I can see the static day, week, month and year graphs but cannot see the live graphs or gauges.
    The live gauges cannot connect to live readings over a file:// browser connection.
    One easy way view live gauges and charts on a local filesystem is to run a simple python webserver from your
    public_html folder and connect to that using your browser:
      cd [location of your weewx public_html folder]
      python -m http.server 8080

      In your browser, connect to http://localhost:8080/Bootstrap


Installation - The involved way
===============================

Step 1 - Download from github:
------------------------------

To get the latest development code:
   git clone git://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer

To get the latest stable(ish) release, point your browser here:
   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

Move gaugeengine.py, gauges.py, historyengine,py and translateengine.py into the bin/user directory.
Move the Bootstrap and Images directory into the skins directory.
Move any language specific files you want into skins/languages.

Step 2 - Add the skins to weewx.conf
------------------------------------
The [StdReport] section will need to look something like this:

    [StdReport]
        # This section specifies what reports, using which skins, to generate.

        # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        SKIN_ROOT = skins

        # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        HTML_ROOT = public_html

        [[HTMLPages]]
            # This generates the webpages themselves.
            #
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[FTP]]
            skin = Ftp

        [[RSYNC]]
            skin = Rsync


Step 3 - Add Bootstrap support files to your website
----------------------------------------------------
Add these files to weewx/public_html/js:
    bootstrap.min.js
    ekko-lightbox.min.js

and this one to weewx/public_html/css:
    css/bootstrap.min.css

You can use the wget command to download these:
    wget https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css
    wget https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js
    wget https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ekko-lightbox/4.0.1/ekko-lightbox.min.js

Step 4 - (Optional) Display skins in another language
-----------------------------------------------------
Just choose your language using the "language" setting in the [Languages] section of skin.conf.

Remember to make changes to both skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf (for the html text) and skins/Images/skin.conf (for
the graphs).
